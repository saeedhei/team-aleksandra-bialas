# System Architecture Overview

## Overview

The Learning Management System (LMS) is a web application designed to manage course content, users, and interactions in an educational setting. The system is built using a **Node.js** backend with **Express.js** and a **CouchDB** database for data storage.

### Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: CouchDB
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication
- **Caching**: Redis (optional)
- **Message Queue**: Kafka

### Key Components

1. **API Layer (Express.js)**: Handles HTTP requests, processes business logic, and interacts with the database. Exposes RESTful API endpoints.
2. **Database (CouchDB)**: NoSQL database for storing user data, courses, and other entities in a flexible JSON format.
3. **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication system that validates user login and generates access tokens.
4. **Caching**: Redis is used for caching frequently accessed data to reduce database load.

### Flow of Data

1. When a user makes a request (e.g., to view courses), the request is routed to the appropriate **Express.js controller**.
2. The controller interacts with the **CouchDB** database to fetch or manipulate data.
3. If authentication is required, the **JWT token** is validated to verify the user's identity before proceeding with the request.
4. Responses are sent back to the client in a standardized JSON format.
